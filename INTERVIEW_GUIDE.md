## 🛡️ Safety & LOTO {#safety}

### The "Testing for Dead" Protocol

**Expected Answer:**
```
1. Identify all energy sources (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, etc.)
2. Shut down equipment using normal stopping procedure
3. Isolate all energy sources (open disconnects, close valves)
4. Apply LOTO devices (each worker applies their own lock)
5. Release stored energy (capacitors, springs, gravity)
6. VERIFY: Test for dead with a known-working tester
   - Test tester on known live source first
   - Test each phase (A-B, B-C, C-A, A-G, B-G, C-G)
   - Test tester again on known live source (verify tester didn't fail)
7. Only then begin work
```

### Common Safety Questions

**Q: "What PPE for working on a 480V panel?"**
```
A: "Category 2 or 3 arc flash suit (depending on incident energy),
    face shield, insulated gloves with leather protectors,
    flame-resistant clothing, safety glasses, hard hat,
    and insulated tools."
```

**Q: "When do you need an arc flash study?"**
```
A: "NFPA 70E requires arc flash risk assessment for any equipment
    that could be worked on energized. Labels must show incident
    energy, arc flash boundary, and required PPE."
```

## 🔧 Motor Controls {#motors}

### Common Motor Questions

**Q: "A motor won't start. Walk me through troubleshooting."**
```
A: 1. Verify power is available (check voltage at disconnect)
    2. Check overloads (reset if tripped)
    3. Check control circuit (start/stop buttons, contactor coil)
    4. Verify contactor is pulling in
    5. Check motor terminals (T1, T2, T3)
    6. Megger test motor windings (check for shorts/grounds)
    7. Check mechanical load (bound bearings, seized equipment)
    8. Verify motor rotation (single-phasing)
```

**Q: "What's the difference between across-the-line and soft start?"**
```
A: "Across-the-line applies full voltage immediately - high inrush
    current (6x FLC), mechanical stress. Soft start ramps voltage
    gradually - reduced inrush, less mechanical wear, controlled
    acceleration."
```

## 🧠 Behavioral Questions {#behavioral}

### STAR Method Framework

**S**ituation - Set the context
**T**ask - What needed to be done
**A**ction - What YOU specifically did
**R**esult - The outcome (quantify if possible)

### Sample Questions & Answers

**Q: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a supervisor."**
```
S: "On a commercial job, the foreman wanted to use 12 AWG for a
    20A circuit that was 150ft from the panel."
T: "I knew voltage drop would be excessive."
A: "I respectfully showed him the voltage drop calculation using
    our app. Demonstrated it would be 4.5% VD, exceeding NEC
    recommendation of 3%."
R: "He agreed to upsize to 10 AWG. The inspector complimented our
    work. Learned that data beats opinion every time."
```

**Q: "Describe a time you went above and beyond."**
```
S: "Residential service call - customer's power kept tripping."
T: "Previous electrician couldn't find the fault."
A: "Spent 2 extra hours methodically testing each circuit. Found
    a nail through a Romex in the attic that wasn't visible."
R: "Fixed the fault, restored power. Customer left a 5-star review
    and referred 3 new customers. Company got $15K in new work."
```
